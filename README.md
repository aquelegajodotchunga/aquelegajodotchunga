# Hi, I'm Maxwell! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer with a solid decade of experience** building and managing software solutions. My passion lies in crafting applications that deliver real value, from concept to deployment.

On the **back-end**, I leverage the full power of **Spring Boot** and its ecosystem, crafting high-performance APIs and scalable systems with **Java**. My **front-end** expertise ensures dynamic, responsive, and intuitive user experiences, with **React**, but also proficient with **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **SCSS**, **Thymeleaf**, and **Bootstrap**.

I bring deep proficiency in **database management**, working extensively with **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** for data integrity and optimal performance. **While these are my primary focus, my experience extends to other relational and NoSQL databases, ensuring adaptability to diverse data landscapes.** Beyond code, I have a proven track record in **application deployment and management** on platforms like **DigitalOcean**, covering everything from full environment setup to domain management, secure backups, and effective restores across **Linux** and **Windows** environments.

My background isn't just in development, it's complemented by extensive experience in **systems administration and technical support**. This view allows me to approach projects with a focus on performance, reliability, and end-to-end quality.
